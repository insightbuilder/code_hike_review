### Learning in this project

There are so many moving parts that needs to be understood for making the 
code hike to work.

0) Use typescript when starting the project with npx create-next-app@latest

1) Use the package.json directly from the starter_hike project

2) The tailwind.config.ts and postcss.config.js also need to be copied

3) next.config.js has one "code" key for taking the Code components, so using multiple code block related example in same project will be a challenge. 
All the code related highlights, and selections needs to be covered in single code.tsx file under the components

4) Individual codeblocks examples can be experimented in different pages. Due to the current limitation in my understanding as to how to bring them together, I am deciding to have one example per project.  

Directly moving to token-transitions next, as that is the main target for this entire review.

This can be done using the starter_hike itself.
