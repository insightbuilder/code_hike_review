The project was used for diving into the details of what each files are 
doing. 

The key files outside the App are:

- next.config.mjs

- mdx-components-tsx

The Files that are common to Routes:

- layout.tsx

- global.css

- components folder with the tsx files for annotations, and extracting blocks

The files required for each Route:

- page.mdx (Any other file name, then the route will throw 404 error)
