## Even if I don't understand anything

I can use the template in scrolly coding as it is. 

The page.tsx works for the title and children in the side bar. That I can see

In addition, the same content.mdx can be copied to another route, and 
it can be rendered with out any challenge.

Got all the three transition examples to work in this project.
