This is bare minimum project that just renders the markdown as html 

The requisite files are still there similar to what is found in starter_hike and code_blocks. 

What is different?

In addition, we can see the welcome-page route contain "page.js" file to render the route. Its rendering the data from the welcome.md inside the markdown folder in the root of the project.
